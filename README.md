# Introduction
This is a repo for recreating the result of the paper 
"NEMt: Explaining Medical Image Models Trained by Supervised or Unsupervised Learning via NeuralExplanation Masks"
To recreate the results of our experiments:
1. Use supervised_lesion.ipynb to run the experiments on the HAM10000 dataset
2. Use supervised_lung.ipynb to run the supervised experiments on the RSNA dataset
3. Use unsupervised_lung.ipynb to run the unsupervised experiments on the RSNA dataset 

# Setup
1. please use conda to install the  environment.yml file and ensure that the correct environment is used to run the notebooks
2. ensure that the HAM10000 and RSNA datasets are downloaded and correct pathing have been established in the notebooks
3. ensure that the medclip pretrained weights have been downloaded and correct pathing have been established in the notebook
